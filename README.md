## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

I leant more about tailwindcss utility classes and how they are properly used.




### Continued development

I will want to explore tailwindcss's group utility class, The mechanism with which they work and how they are used.



### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/) - It is my most used resource. I only used others when a concept is confusing.
- [CHATGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This helped me many times when am lost. I really liked it and will will advice those who haven't tried it to please do.
- [GOOGLE](https://www.google.com) - Some times I had to navigate google to get the neccessary clue when everything seems confusing. I'd recommend who is still in my level to do same.
